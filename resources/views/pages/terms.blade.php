Using Blockchain technology, Artojours eliminates the point system, which delays the instant use of cashback and rewards, by introducing Artojours Tokens (ARTX) and the online marketplace ‘Artojours Blockchain’, where transactions take place in single-currency ARTXs on a global scale. There are no borders, no regulations and no restrictions by central bodies. Rather, all transactions are on a distributed-ledger Blockchain without the involvement of central authorities, thus making it safe, secure and auditable due to its distributed nature over P2P nodes.</p></li>
