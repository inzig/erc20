                <p class="p-about">
                    BARTVault enables artists and art owners to protect their art through encrypted ‘Provenance Tokens’ on the blockchain. The Tokens prevent altering of vital information of art assets and their chain of custody, both necessary to protect their value. The system further enables frictionless P2P transactions using smart contracts that govern terms and conditions. BARTVault, with its underlying features of a 'trust protocol', cryptography and immutable global distributed ledger tracks the movement of the asset throughout its life – providing a complete 'chaîne de garde pour Toujours' (chain of custody for ever) to significantly reduce the incidents of forgery in art commerce.
