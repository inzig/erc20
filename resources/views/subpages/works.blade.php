                        <p class="h1-content">This is the basic Token in the BARTVault system and will be on sale at the ICO. The name ARISTON is derived from Greek word ‘Aristos’ which means "best and most excellent." The ARISTON represents a medium of exchange in the Platform and will be at the heart of BARTVault’s ecosystem enabling to federate a strong Art Community incentivized to use ARTZ’s. The token gives a concrete and an essential utility for all stakeholders with its numerous uses on the platform that facilitate a robust ‘token economy’ with incentive mechanisms.  </p>

                        <p class="h1-content">Each Art asset in the Platform can only have one PROVINER Token registered on the Blockchain in order to uniquely identify the asset and prevent from forgery and misuse. This token confirms the identity of the asset along with its authenticity, location and condition. The token will remain on the Blockchain forever (Toujours) with an immutable ‘chain of custody’ record.   A user holding the Provenir Token will be the owner of the underlying art asset and will have all ownership rights and privileges linked to that art asset.</p>

                        <p class="h1-content">The Token owner encodes usage rights and permissions to the art asset in the PDT. Provenir derivative tokens are linked to specific PROVENIR Tokens and represent and grant rights to create derivative works (such as a specific number of prints, copies, or other use rights provided in the PDT).  Each PROVENIR can have multiple PDT’s outstanding – that is for any single PROVENIR there can exist a number of PDT’s – each with varying permissions.
